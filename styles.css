Introduction
This example of a School Capacity page takes a sample of schools data from https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/ and then displays a circle representing the school capacity and the school name on a svg representing the coordinates returned from https://www.getthedata.com/open-postcode-geo-api

Task
User feedback has indicated the current map is difficult to use once all schools are displayed due to overlapping elements
Complete the task below to rewrite the School capacity javascript to display Local Authorities capacity and names instead of schools
You are not expected to change the utility functions to complete this task
We will use different sample data to compare your solution with our reference solution

Scenario: User views the LA Capacity page
  When a user views the page
  When the page has loaded
  Then the SVG id="cont" displays a circle for each local authority
  And each circle is scaled according to the school capacity of that local authority
  And each circle is located in an appropriate location for that local authority
  And each circle is labelled with the local authority name
