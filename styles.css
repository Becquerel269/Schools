Introduction
This example of a School Capacity page takes a sample of schools data from https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/ and then displays a circle representing the school capacity and the school name on a svg representing the coordinates returned from https://www.getthedata.com/open-postcode-geo-api

Task
User feedback has indicated the current map is difficult to use once all schools are displayed due to overlapping elements
Complete the task below to rewrite the School capacity javascript to display Local Authorities capacity and names instead of schools
You are not expected to change the utility functions to complete this task
We will use different sample data to compare your solution with our reference solution

Scenario: User views the LA Capacity page
  When a user views the page
  When the page has loaded
  Then the SVG id="cont" displays a circle for each local authority
  And each circle is scaled according to the school capacity of that local authority
  And each circle is located in an appropriate location for that local authority
  And each circle is labelled with the local authority name

Recoded as per instructions above - extra comments in code to explain my approach

In a real world scenario I would:

Seek confirmation from the end user what they mean by "according to the school capacity of that local authority"

Consider whether an alternative solution would better fit the requirement from the end user that was "current map is difficult to use once all schools are displayed due to overlapping elements".

The current solution has the following problems:
Circle elements and names still overlap but not as much (tried dividing SumCapacity by 10, but names still overlap)
User feedback didn't mention summing capacities by local authority
Using a circle is misleading as doubling the capacity increases the area of the circle by a factor of four
Some schools do not fit on this diagram, they don't have a postcode becuase they are not in the UK (in my solution I have filtered these out, may not be what the user wanted)
The Department of Education as far as I'm aware only covers England as Education is devolved in Wales, however there is a School in Wales in the schoolsdata 
The code is written in raw Javascript which has problems with global variables, not statically typed and may not be capatible with some browers (I have used es6 method where posssible)
It is also difficult to unit test

A better fitting solution might be to:
Use a modern framework such angular or react (browser capability and unit testing)
Use typescript instead of javascript (statically typed)
Use google maps integration so that all schools can be shown and user can view only the details they are interested by clicking on a pin, a example of something similar is at: https://codesandbox.io/s/n9lrxw0670?file=/src/locations.json 
The above also solves the circle scaling issue
